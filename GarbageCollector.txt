when memory created dynamically and no one is refering to it then it is called garbage.
reclaiming the  memory not refered and is no longer needed and making available for others is called garbage collection
Garbage collection is a program which is running in background 
there are two ways to call garbage collector 
1.System class-> System.gc()
2.Runtime class->Runtime rt = new Runtime.getRuntime(); ->rt.gc();
finalize() method -> this method is inside object class , to modify this we have to override it ->public void finalize()
it is similar to destroctor in c++
this method is called automatically before performing gc to perform cleanup activites as closing file, or database connection etc.
sometimes object may hold references of other resources like file , database then garbge collector is not able to free hence we have to write explicitly.
